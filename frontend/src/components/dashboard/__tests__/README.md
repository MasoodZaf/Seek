## Test Infrastructure

### Mocking Strategy
- **Framer Motion**: Mocked to avoid animation issues in tests
- **React Router**: Wrapped components in BrowserRouter for navigation testing
- **Auth Context**: Mocked to provide consistent user data
- **Fetch API**: Mocked for API call testing
- **UI Components**: Mocked with test-friendly implementations

### Test Utilities
- **React Testing Library**: For component rendering and queries
- **User Event**: For realistic user interaction simulation
- **Jest**: For test framework and mocking
- **Fake Timers**: For testing time-dependent functionality

### Coverage Areas
1. **Functional Testing**: Core component functionality and user interactions
2. **Integration Testing**: Component interaction with external dependencies
3. **Accessibility Testing**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
4. **Performance Testing**: Large dataset handling and memoization
5. **Error Handling**: API failures, malformed data, edge cases
6. **Responsive Testing**: Mobile and tablet viewport adaptations

## Running Tests
